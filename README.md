# PV-System-Simulation
## A study and simulation environment for PV systems in India
### Aditya Pandey and Amal Nair

The aim of this project is to study and ultimately build out an active simulation environment of various solar photovoltaic designs and configurations. Moreover, it seeks to simulate the electric yield, profitability, and impact of such projects as a means for driving consumer behavior. The goal here is to provide people with an accurate visualization and information breakdown, to provide clarity towards the decision to switch to solar. 

- The Need: While existing resources provide consumers with a generalized idea of solar costs (usually at a national or "average individual" level), there is a substantial lack of personalized analysis into the impact solar can have for a given person. We aim to address this issue, by providing location specific simulations as well as a detailed personal cost benefit analysis. 

- The Approach: Our solution will contain a web embedded application, wherein consumers can enter their address as well as details for available roof space/land for solar access, and ultimately get an accurate representation of their electric yield and costs incurred. To achieve this, we plan on creating a back end modeling environment that accounts for multiple factors, including:
  - Rate of Solar in the Local Area
  - Average yield from local solar installations
  - Rotation Ability and optimal direction
  - Local Climate Patterns year round
  - Cost of solar installations as quoted by local vendors
  - Other miscellaneous factors including maintainence, local policy, etc. 
 
- Benefits: The benefits to solar consumers are as stated above, with increased visibility and numerical information tailored for them to make informed decisions. In addition, our hope is to further such simulation to make the case for larger scale projects and help such projects get started.

- Competition/Alternatives: Currently, consumers (ex: rooftop solar consumers) can get a generic sense of the benefits of rooftop solar in their area. For a more perrsonalized inquiry, they must contact a local solar provider to get something like a quote, but without a clear sense of payoff timeline, whether output would be stable, etc. Not only is there a cost assosciated with doing so, but it's also not the best or more formal mechanism of analysis. Comparatively, this solution offers to minimize that journey to a few  clicks between a prospective solar consumer and a high level overview analysis.
